Squirrel app deployment
----------------------------------
https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/blob/develop/docs/readme.md
----------------------------------
Step 1: 

on the main solution (Inomech) - ManageNuGet packages and add squirrel.windows 

Step 2: 

somewhere on start-up create command for update check (can be in a button)

 public Inomech()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            AddVersionNumber();
            CheckForUpdates();
        }

        private async Task CheckForUpdates() 
        {
            using (var manager = new UpdateManager(@"C:\Temp\Releases")) //folder path where updates are saved - should be accessible for everyone
            {
                await manager.UpdateApp();
            };     
        }

        private void AddVersionNumber() 
        {
            System.Reflection.Assembly assembly = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
            FileVersionInfo versionInfo = FileVersionInfo.GetVersionInfo(assembly.Location);

            this.Text += $" v.{versionInfo.FileVersion}";
        }

Step 3: 

in Properties>Assembly Info - change the Assembly Version and AssemblyFileVersion
switch to release build and build the solution 


Step 4: 

- open NuGet Package Explorer and create a new package
- create lib\net45 folders
- from app Release folder copy everything to lib\net45 apart from anything .pdb (could provide
some source code to the end user as it contains debug options)
- save to the location where the project is 

Step 5:

- in Visual Studio in Package Management Console run PM> Squirrel --releasify Inomech.1.0.0.nupkg // Inomech.1.0.0.nupkg must be the
same name as the name of the NuGet Package that was created
- this creates the installation file ("Releases") in the project folder 
- Copy this to C:\Temp\Releases for future updates 

Squirrel app update
----------------------------------

Step 1: 

Update the app with new code

Step 2: 

- modify the AssemblyVersion in Properties>Assembly Info, save and build Release solution

Step 3: 

- open the NuGet Package created for this app in Step 4 above
- click edit and change the version number 
- copy anything that has been changed (most cases .exe and .config) to the lib\net45 folder (replace all files)
- SaveAs into the same folder but with new version name

Step 4: 

- in VStudio Package Manager Console run PM> Squirrel --releasify Inomech.1.0.1.nupkg //(Inomech.1.0.1.nupkg) - must reflect the new version of the SavedAs NuGetPackage
